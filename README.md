# Tesla Website Clone
Author - Suman Saha

Welcome to my Tesla Website Clone project! This site is built with React JS and styled using Tailwind CSS, aiming to replicate the sleek, user-friendly experience of the official Tesla website. While this project serves as a tribute to the design and functionality of Tesla's own site, it's also a showcase of my skills in responsive web design, modern CSS frameworks, and React development.

## Features

- **Fully Responsive Design**: Crafted with Tailwind CSS to provide an optimal viewing experience across a wide range of devices. Whether you're browsing on your desktop, tablet, or mobile phone, the layout seamlessly adjusts to fit your screen.
  
- **Selective Functional Links**: Utilizing `react-router-dom` for navigation, while not all links are operational, key sections of the website are fully functional. These include:
  - **Vehicles**: Explore the range of Tesla vehicles.
  - **Support**: Access support resources and customer service.
  - **Customer Order**: Place an order for your new Tesla.
  - **Demo Drive**: Schedule a test drive to experience a Tesla firsthand.

- **High-Fidelity Clone**: Efforts have been made to closely replicate the look and feel of the original Tesla website. From the navigation menu to the vehicle showcase, I've tried to capture the essence of Tesla's brand and design philosophy.

## Technologies Used

- **React JS**: The core technology behind this project, enabling dynamic content management and a responsive user interface.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling and responsive design, ensuring a visually appealing and adaptable user experience.
- **react-router-dom**: To manage routing and navigation within the application, providing a seamless user flow.
- **JavaScript**: To add interactivity and enhance functionality.
